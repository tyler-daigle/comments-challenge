# Frontendmentor.io Comments Section Challenge

This page was created for the [Frontendmentor Comments section challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9)

I created the page using **React** and **CSS modules** for all the styling. The
page uses **Grid and Flexbox** to achieve the responsive design laid out in
the design files. Some of the items in the comments are positioned
differently based on whether the user is viewing it on mobile or
desktop.

The app doesn't work 100%. You can add replies to other comments, but
you cannot edit or delete them. There is no backend to this app,
everything is just loaded from a static object and replies you create
will not exist if you refresh the page. The app was mostly built for the
design practice.

The app is hosted on [Netlify](https://peaceful-lichterman-f197c5.netlify.app/).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
